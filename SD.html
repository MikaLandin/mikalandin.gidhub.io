									<h2 class="major">Social Design</h2>
									<p>During my exchange semester at Upper School of Arts and Design (Polit√©cnico de Leiria) in Portugal I took the course 
									Graphic Design III. In this course I got the individual task to create a Social Design.
									<br />
									<h1>About Social Design</h1>
									Social design is a branch of design that contribute to positive change in society through awareness and / or prevention, or even direct
									various phenomena related to social problems - in health, the environment and its resources, and the quality of life in different cultures.
									<br />
									<br /> The task was to look at the everyday life and choose a study element that presents a dilemma and apply it graphically in order to
									enhance an informative message and educating.
									<br />
									<br />
									<h1>My Project</h1>
									<b>Research</b>
									<br />
									Since my everyday life at my exchange semester was different from my everyday life home in Stockholm I decided to take advantage
									of the differences that I observed when I lived in Portugal comparing to Sweden. A difference that I observed was the everyday recycle process.
									<br />
									<br /> Research made me realize that there are currently fewer people recycling in Portugal,
									while at the same time the population is producing more waste. Therefor I chose to make a Social 
									Design of the everyday recycling. In Portugal there are three containers for recycling, one for plastic and metal, one for glass and one for paper. 
									This is a big difference from the everyday recycle that I was used to in Sweden where we usually have containers for food, metal, glass, colored glass, 
									paper, printed paper, soft plastic and hard plastic.
									<br />
									<br />
									<b>My work</b>
									<br />
									<br /> To educate people in their everyday recycling I made a social design to make the people interact with the object. The result was four posters that 
									is supposed to be placed in the areas where people pass everyday. On each poster there is two transparent boxes so that you can see how much garbage there is inside.
									<br />
									<br /> Each poster has a question so that you can interact by putting in your recyclable object. This will make the person that pass the posers wonder what it is and
									hopefully wanting to be a part of it. At the end of every poster there is some information to educate and to spread the information about the importance of recycling.
									The questions on the posters and the information at the end of each posters has the purpose to educate about the diffrent materials and the importance to recycle each
									material by it self so that it can be used for other things. 
									<br />

									<h1>What I learned</h1>
									During the project I learned a lot of working with Photoshop. The project made me practice to work
 									individually on a project and I learned the importance of getting people interested in interacting with my design.
