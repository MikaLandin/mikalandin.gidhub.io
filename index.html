										<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
										<p> I have graduated from Stockholm University with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science majoring in Interaction Design. 
										For a long time, I have had a great interest in behavioral science and what lies behind people's actions. I have also had a great interest in design and technology. 
										When I became aware of the interaction design program, I felt that this was the right education for me. 
										I was given the opportunity to combine my interest in human behavior and technology.
										<br />
										<br /> 
										My education at Stockholm University has given me good theoretical knowledge and the opportunity to develop and test prototypes with the users. 
										I wanted to supplement my theoretical education with more practical courses, therefor I applied for an exchange semester. 
										I spent the fall of 2019 in a small town located north of Lisbon at Upper School of Arts and Design (Politécnico de Leiria). 
										Here I got the opportunity for practical courses like Graphic design projects, typography and analog photography.
										<br />
										<br /> 
										I am excited to learn more and to start working with my great interest UX-design.
