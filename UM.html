									<h2 class="major">Evaluation methods</h2>
									<p>This project was made by me and two other student in my Bachelorâ€™s Programme in <a href="https://www.su.se/english/search-courses-and-programmes/siadk-1.411900">Interaction Design</a> at Stockholm University. 
									The aim of the evaluation methods project was to test the usability assessments of a digital product.
									<br />
									<h1>The study</h1>
									The purpose of the study was to investigate what usability issues that exist in the interface in the chat function Snapchat in relation to WhatsApp for inexperienced users and to see which of them that has the most usability problems.
									<br />
									<br /> 
									<b>Method</b>
									<br /> We evaluated the usability in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction. 
									10 user tests were performed, the user test included 7 tasks that were recorded in video, 
									and a form in which the participants individually answered a number of questions. 
									5 participants were allowed to test the application Snapchat and 5 other participants were allowed to test the application WhatsApp.
									<br />
									<br /> 
									We chose to perform the tests in one of the contexts that the application Snapchat and WhatsApp are usually use, at home. 
									All tests were filmed according to screen recording and gave us the opportunity to subsequently evaluate the use of the applications, according to efficiency and effectiveness.
									<br />
									<br /> 
									Efficiency was measured in terms of number of clicks to reach the target. This data was collected through video clips on the screen and then after the user test evaluate the results.
									<br />
									<br /> 
									Effectiveness was measured in the number of tasks completed by the participants. This was done through video clips on the screen that were evaluated after the user test.
									<br />
									<br /> 
									Satisfaction was measured using a scale of 1 to 4 in the form, as well as questions about the participant's experience of interacting with the interfaces.
									<br />
									<br />
									<b>Results</b>
									<br />
									The application WhatsApp's results showed that participants did not have difficulty managing this system compared to Snapchat. 
									The use of Snapchat showed some usability issues. More and more clicks were made when using snapchat compared to using WhatsApp.
									<br />
									<br />The users who tested WhatsApp did not encounter any problems that prevented them from completing the tasks, 
									indicating a good efficiency. All participants were able to perform the tasks. 
									The only problem that caused more clicks was that it was confusing for two of the participants to find themselves in 
									the search field, as there was no clear search box at the start page. 
									One of the participants failed on the first attempt to record a video, the participant quickly corrected this on the second 
									attempt and showed that he understood how it would go, this showed that there were no major question marks about this task. 
									Participants expressed in the form that they did not experience any discomfort, this indicates good satisfaction. 
									The results evaluated indicate that Whatsapp does not have many usability issues.
									<br />
									<br />
									<b>Re-design</b>
									<br />
									The second picture is a recommendation for re-design based on the identified problems.
									When the participants were to take a picture or record a clip, there were problems to understand the circle that you use on Snapchat.
									Instead, we recommend adding a camera icon inside the circle and a video icon so that users can navigate to the camera and video recording. 
									When the users got the task to make a video call they instead clicked on the recordning. 
									We recommend that the video call and call symbols in interface are placed high up in the chat next to each other.

									<h1>My part</h1>
									The project was a opportunity to learn how to evaluate an application by user tests, therefore every member of the group were involved in all the preparations, the tests and the analysis.
									<br />
									<br />
									During the project I learned different methods to measure  effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. I also learned that recording can be a good way to communicate the usability issues with colleagues to get everyone involved in the 
									possible problems regarding effectiveness and efficiency.
